A real-time multiplayer chess application inspired by Chess.com! Built with Express.js, Chess.js, and Socket.IO, this project delivers an interactive and seamless chess-playing experience with real-time updates.

♟️ Features

🎮 Real-time Multiplayer Gameplay – Challenge friends or strangers in a fast-paced chess battle.

🕹️ Interactive UI – Enjoy a clean and intuitive interface built using EJS templates.

⚡ Instant Moves & Updates – Powered by Socket.IO for smooth and efficient real-time communication.

🤖 Smart Move Validation – Chess.js ensures every move follows the official chess rules.

📜 Modular & Scalable Code – Designed for future enhancements and easy maintenance.

🚀 Technologies Used

Languages & Tools

JavaScript (Backend & Frontend)

EJS (Dynamic Templating)

Frameworks & Libraries

Express.js – Manages server-side logic and routes.

Socket.IO – Handles real-time bidirectional communication.

Chess.js – Implements chess game logic and move validation.

🔥 How It Works

Real-Time Communication

Players connect and play chess against each other in real time using Socket.IO, ensuring instant move synchronization.

Chess Logic & Rules

The Chess.js library guarantees that all moves comply with chess regulations, preventing illegal moves.

Frontend Experience

EJS templates dynamically render the chessboard and UI elements, keeping the experience smooth and immersive.
